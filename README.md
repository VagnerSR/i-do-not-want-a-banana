# i-do-not-want-a-banana
Just having fun and practicing React


I used React with Javascript, that’s what I was learning and I wanted to practice with something for fun that I could show my friends ^^. My first idea was to have an area where you could move the bananas freely and Winston would only speak when given a banana, but couldn’t figure out how to do it, so I found a video on YouTube showing how to use React-beautiful-dnd and I started from there. I made Winston speak with the event onMouseUp which worked fine on desktop, except the fact that you can just click on Winton and he will speak, but it didn’t work how I planned on mobile. 
All this issues that I had hopefully with time I’ll learn how to fix and be able to really do what I want it but for now it is what it is ^^.
